# onedrive-java-client

A cross-platform command line client for Microsoft OneDrive written in Java 7.

__This application is currently in BETA - use with caution__

## Installation

(1) Download and extract the [latest release](https://github.com/wooti/onedrive-java-client/releases/download/0.2/onedrive-java-client.zip).

(2) Authorise the application

An authorisation token must be created to grant the application secure access to OneDrive. Run the following command to generate the authorisation URL:
```
java -jar onedrive-java-client.jar --authorise
```
Open the URL in your browser, and wait for it to redirect you to a blank page. Copy and paste the address shown in your address bar into your keyfile (default file ``onedrive.key``).

(3) Start synchronising folders
```
java -jar onedrive-java-client.jar --direction UP --local . --remote MyTargetFolder/
```

## Build

(1) Grab the latest source code
```
git clone https://github.com/wooti/onedrive-java-client.git
cd onedrive-java-client
```

(2) Build the application using [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/)
```
mvn clean package -DskipTests
```

    --local <path>               the local path
    --logfile <file>             log to file
 -M,--max-size <size_in_KB>      only process files smaller than <size> KB
 -n,--dry-run                    only do a dry run without making changes

 -y,--tries <count>              try each service request <count> times
```

## Synchronisation Modes

The application currently supports one-way mirroring of data, so it will create, update and delete files as necessary to make the target side match the source side.
* ``--direction UP`` - Mirrors a local folder to a remote OneDrive folder
* ``--direction DOWN`` - Mirrors a remote OneDrive folder to a local folder

Note that the local and target folder must both exist for this to work.

### Moving / Renaming Files

The client does not currently maintain a local record of changes, so renamed and moved files are detected as brand new files and uploaded. The old file will be deleted.

### Large Files

For files larger than 5MB (configurable with ``--split-after``), onedrive-java-client will split the upload into blocks of 5MB. This reduces the cost of a temporary network failure, as at most the last 5MB of any upload will need to be re-sent.

### Data Integrity

By default files are compared by looking at the size, created date and last modified date. For additional safety the ``--hash-compare`` flag can be specified which forces a CRC32 hash check for each file.

The ``--dry-run`` option can be used to test the synchronisation operation, this executes the operation without applying any changes.
